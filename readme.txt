== Notes ==
* Requires WordPress 3.6 or higher!

* Pullquote uses the theme editor "excerpt." Be sure it is activated from admin "Screen Options" menu in upper right.

* All navigation to main top menu is parent recursive. If you have a menu with sub pages then the top link will not be clickable unless you turn off the option to use mobile nav in the Customizer. 

* To set up social media links in the page footer: Appearance > Menus - then <Custom Links> to the left. Footer does not support depths of the child links below it. (No drop downs)
